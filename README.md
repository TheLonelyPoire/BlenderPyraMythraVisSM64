# BlenderPyraMythraVisSM64

A quick Blender script for visualizing how the inverted pyramid platforms in BitFS move, and how PU rotational displacement occurs. 


## Installation/Setup

The installation/setup process is a bit scuffed, but the steps are as follows:
1. Download the python file from here (hereafter referred to as the script).
2. Open Blender, and then open both a Text Window and a 3D Viewport Window.
3. Open the sidebar of the 3D Viewport if it isn't already open by pressing N or using the small arrow on the top-right of the viewport.
4. Open the script in the Text Window using the file browser in the toolbar and click Run.
5. Open the menu on the sidebar of the 3D Viewport labeled "SM64."
6. Expand the panel labeled "Pyra Mythra Basis Visualizer."


## Overview

This script allows you to generate the relevant geometry of BitFS, tilt the pyramid platform by setting the normal as desired, visualize the principal axes of the tilted pyramid platform, visualize the principal axes after a frame of platform movement, and visualize how Mario is moved by the platform.

More details to be added soon.
